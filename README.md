## Project Goal and Description
To extract EPL match statistics for the 2015-16 season, to perform descriptive analysis and express how Leicester won the Premier League title through vivid and elusive data visualization techniques.

We aim to visualize that all teams in the given EPL season, where did a given team stand as compared to others in given EPL seasons and how did they progress eventually with every season. In the end, we also want to determine how Leicester clinched the trophy and was the most dominant EPL team in the given tenure.
